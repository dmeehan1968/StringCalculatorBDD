# Roy Osherove's String Calculator Kata in Gherkin for Cucumber, Behat, et al

This contains Gherkin feature files that describe the steps from [Roy Osherove's String Calculator
Kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1).

You can use this as a submodule in your own implementation to save on the effort of rewriting 
the scenarios.

The features are laid out in the same order as the Kata, with scenarios to cope with different 
requirements where mentioned in the text.
